      <b class='heading'> CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways : </b> <br> 

     
      <ul type='circle' >
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an External CSS file</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However , 
                <span class='highlight'>  in this tutorial we will see inline and internal styles, </span> 
                because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it by yourself

                style or set of styles can be applied to the element
            </p1> </p>
